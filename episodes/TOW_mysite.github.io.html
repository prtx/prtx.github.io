		<h1>TOW mysite.github.io</h1>
		<p>So we are going to start the first episode of the saga by creating a web page similar to the one you are looking at. We will create your github account, add your repo for assignments and create yoursite.github.io to show it off.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Git, Github</h2>
		<p>Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. As a distributed revision control system it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.</p>
		<p>GitHub is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.</p>
		<p>Start by creating a github account <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>. There you can create your own repository <em>(your-repository for now)</em> Then install git via terminal.</p>
		<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install git
		</code></pre>
		<p>Once thats done open your project directory in your PC. Now we will clone your-repository (by clone we mean create a copy pf it in your locan machine) using the web address of the repository itself.</p>
		<pre><code>$ git clone link-of-your-repository
		</code></pre>
		<p>Now say you wanna add a file <em>a_file.txt</em> to your repository. Well in that case create a_file.txt in the folder and follow the following.</p>
		<pre><code>$ git add a_file.txt #add file contents to your staging area before you can commit them
$ git commit -m "Commit message" #confirm your changes
$ git push #update your online repository
		</code></pre>
		<p>One other interesting command is</p>
		<pre><code>$ git status # see what the status of your staging area is compared to the code in your working directory
		</code></pre>
		<p>This is just the gist of it. To learn more read <a href="http://gitref.org/">here</a>.</p>
		<p>To create yoursite.github.io follow given steps.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a repository using your github username username.github.io.</li>
			<li>Upload your static web pages. Make sure your main page is index.html and in the root folder of your repository.</li>
			<li><strong>Note:</strong> You can only make sites using your own username.</li>
		</ol>
